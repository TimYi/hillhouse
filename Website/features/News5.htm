Our vision is to be company with global footprint through our innovative products and services.”<br><br>

“This is the largest quantum of fund raise in this segment in India so far. We see the second round of investment as an endorsement of our strategy and progress so far. Our revenues have grown three-fold since 2013 when we received our first round of funding from Sequoia, and we are doubling our lead generation Y-O-Y. This is the time we are looking to rapidly expand our business and therefore the funding adds to our fast paced growth in the online auto portal segment” he further added.<br><br>

Mr. Anurag Jain, COO and Co-Founder, GirnarSoft said, “This is a very exciting time for the company and a high point in the Indian automobile industry. With this funding we have plans to enhance the technology and services of CarDekho.com along with increased focus on brand building and marketing initiatives of the company.

We are excited to be partnering with such an exceptional management team to continue to build and grow this business over the long term.”<br><br>

Also, sharing views on this partnership, Mr. Eashwar Krishnan, Portfolio Manager of Tybourne Capital said, “We have a substantial amount of capital invested across global classified assets and are excited to add CarDekho to our portfolio.

We look forward to partnering with the management team as the company moves into its next phase of growth.”<br><br>
